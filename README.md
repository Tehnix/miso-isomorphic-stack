# Miso Isomorphic Example using Stack
This is an expansion of the [Single page isomorphic example](https://github.com/FPtje/miso-isomorphic-example), which is a minimal example of Miso's isomorphic features.

This example has been updated to use the most current version of Miso at the time of writing, version _0.17.0_, and more importantly only uses stack, instead of relying on nix. The ultimate goal of this, is to provide a stack compatible full setup, that also works nicely with existing tooling. The last bit (tooling) is now the remaining focus of this example.

For more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the [Miso isomorphic example]([Single page isomorphic example](https://github.com/FPtje/miso-isomorphic-example)), which links to some great resources.
